Vercel serverless functions work automatically with no special setup when you deploy via GitHub. Here's what you need to know:

**It Just Works:**
- Any files in `/api` (for vanilla JS/TS) or `/app/api` (for Next.js App Router, which you're using) are automatically deployed as serverless functions
- Vercel detects your Next.js project and configures everything automatically

**Your Current Setup:**
Looking at your project structure, you already have API routes in `app/api/`:
- `generate-recipe/route.ts`
- `generate-image/route.ts`
- `analyze/route.ts`

These will automatically become serverless functions at:
- `/api/generate-recipe`
- `/api/generate-image`
- `/api/analyze`

**Only Things to Check:**
1. **Environment Variables** - Add your API keys (like OpenAI) in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
2. **Function Timeout** - Free tier has 10s timeout, Pro has 60s. If your AI calls take longer, you may need Pro or streaming responses
3. **Region** - By default deploys to `iad1` (Washington DC). You can change this in project settings if needed

**That's it.** Push to GitHub, Vercel builds and deploys automatically. No additional configuration needed for the functions themselves.
